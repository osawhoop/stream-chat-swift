# ChatChannelWatcherListControllerDelegate

`ChatChannelWatcherListController` uses this protocol to communicate changes to its delegate.

``` swift
public protocol ChatChannelWatcherListControllerDelegate: DataControllerStateDelegate 
```

This protocol can be used only when no custom extra data are specified. If you're using custom extra data types,
please use `_ChatChannelWatcherListControllerDelegate` instead.
