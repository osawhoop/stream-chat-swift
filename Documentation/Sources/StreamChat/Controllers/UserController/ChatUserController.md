# ChatUserController

`ChatUserController` is a controller class which allows mutating and observing changes of a specific chat user.

``` swift
public typealias ChatUserController = _ChatUserController<NoExtraData>
```

`ChatUserController` objects are lightweight, and they can be used for both, continuous data change observations,
and for quick user actions (like mute/unmute).
